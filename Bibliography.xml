        <abstract>This paper presents results for a maximum-entropy-based part of speech tagger, which achieves superior
            performance principally by enriching the information sources used for tagging. In particular, we get
            improved results by incorporating these features: (i) more extensive treatment of capitalization for unknown
            words; (ii) features for the disambiguation of the tense forms of verbs; (iii) features for disambiguating
            particles from prepositions and adverbs. The best resulting accuracy for the tagger on the Penn Treebank is
            96.86% overall, and 86.91% on previously unseen words.

        <abstract>In this paper we describe an information retrieval system in which advanced natural language
            processing techniques are used to enhance the effectiveness of term-based document retrieval. The backbone
            of our system is a traditional statistical engine that builds inverted index files from pre-processed
            documents, and then searches and ranks the documents in response to user queries. Natural language
            processing is used to (a) preprocess the documents in order to extract content carrying terms, (b) discover
            inter-term dependencies and build a conceptual hierarchy specific to the database domain, and (c) process
            the user's natural language requests into effective search queries. During the course of the Text REtrieval
            Conferences, TREC-1 and TREC-2, our system has evolved from a scaled-up prototype, originally tested on such
            collections as CACM-3204 and Cranfield, to its present form which can be effectively used to process
            hundreds of millions of words of unrestricted text.

        <abstract>We use a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) to represent compactly a variety of sublexical and contextual
            features relevant to Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging. The outcome is a flexible tagger (LegoTag) with
            state-of-the-art performance (3.6% error on a benchmark corpus). We explore the effect of eliminating
            redundancy and radically reducing the size of feature vocabularies. We find that a small but linguistically
            motivated set of suffixes results in improved cross-corpora generalization. We also show that a minimal
            lexicon limited to function words is sufficient to ensure reasonable performance.

        <abstract>The sentence is a standard textual unit in natural language processing applications. In many languages
            the punctuation mark that indicates the end-of-sentence boundary is ambiguous; thus the tokenizers of most
            NLP systems must be equipped with special sentence boundary recognition rules for every new text collection.
            As an alternative, this article presents an efficient, trainable system for sentence boundary
            disambiguation. The system, called Satz, makes simple estimates of the parts of speech of the tokens
            immediately preceding and following each punctuation mark, and uses these estimates as input to a machine
            learning algorithm that then classifies the punctuation mark. Satz is very fast both in training and
            sentence analysis, and its combined robustness and accuracy surpass existing techniques. The system needs
            only a small lexicon and training corpus, and has been shown to transfer quickly and easily from English to
            ether languages, as demonstrated on French and German.

        <abstract>We present a constraint-based morphological disambiguation system in which individual constraints vote
            on matching morphological parses, and disambiguation of all the tokens in a sentence is performed at the end
            by selecting parses that receive the highest votes. This constraint application paradigm makes the outcome
            of the disambiguation independent of the rule sequence, and hence relieves the rule developer from worrying
            about potentially conflicting rule sequencing. Our results for disambiguating Turkish indicate that using
            about 500 constraint rules and some additional simple statistics, we can attain a recall of 95-96% and a
            precision of 94-95% with about 1.01 parses per token. Our system is implemented in Prolog and we are
            currently investigating an efficient implementation based on finite state transducers.

        <abstract>We present statistical models for morphological disambiguation in agglutinative languages, with a
            specific application to Turkish. Turkish presents an interesting problem for statistical models as the
            potential tag set size is very large because of the productive derivational morphology. We propose to handle
            this by breaking up the morhosyntactic tags into inflectional groups, each of which contains the
            inflectional features for each (intermediate) derived form. Our statistical models score the probability of
            each morhosyntactic tag by considering statistics over the individual inflectional groups and surface roots
            in trigram models. Among the four models that we have developed and tested, the simplest model ignoring the
            local morphotactics within words performs the best. Our best trigram model performs with 93.95% accuracy on
            our test data getting all the morhosyntactic and semantic features correct. If we are just interested in
            syntactically relevant features and ignore a very small set of semantic features, then the accuracy
            increases to 95.07%.

        <abstract>In this paper, we describe a solution method for sentence boundary detection in Turkish. The method
            exploits simple heuristic knowledge of Turkish syllabication and its phonetic rules for disambiguation of
            dots. The test accuracy of the algorithm is measured as 96.02%. The main contribution of this study is
            considered as presenting a new lexicon free method for differentiating EOS (end of sentence) dots from the
            ones that are used for other purposes.

        <abstract>In this article, the statistical principal components analysis (PCA) is proposed as a method for
            performance comparisons of different retrieval strategies. It is shown that the PCA method can reveal
            implicit performance relations among retrieval systems across information needs (i.e., queries, topics). For
            illustration, the TREC 12 robust track data have been reevaluated by the PCA method and have been shown to
            reveal easily the performance relations that are hard to see with traditional techniques. Therefore, PCA
            promises a uniform evaluation framework that can be used for large-scale evaluation of retrieval
            experiments. In addition to the mean average precision (MAP) measure, relative analytic distance (RAD) is
            proposed as a new performance summary measure based on the same notion introduced by PCA.

        <abstract>Grammars that expect words from the lexicon may be at odds with the transparent projection of
            syntactic and semantic scope relations of smaller units. We propose a morphosyntactic framework based on
            Combinatory Categorial Grammar that provides flexible constituency, flexible category consistency, and
            lexical projection of morphosyntactic properties and attachment to grammar in order to establish a morphemic
            grammar-lexicon. These mechanisms provide enough expressive power in the lexicon to formulate semantically
            transparent specifications without the necessity to confine structure forming to words and phrases. For
            instance, bound morphemes as lexical items can have phrasal scope or word scope, independent of their
            attachment characteristics but consistent with their semantics. The controls can be attuned in the lexicon
            to language-particular properties. The result is a transparent interface of inflectional morphology, syntax,
            and semantics. We present a computational system and show the application of the framework to English and
            Turkish.

        <abstract>An important aspect of customer relationship management is the targeting of customer segments with
            tailored promotional activities. While most contributions focus on the selection of promising customers for
            targeting, only few authors address the question of which specific differential offers to be directed to the
            selected target groups. We focus on both of these issues and propose a flexible two-stage approach for
            dynamically deriving behaviorally persistent segments and subsequent target marketing selection using retail
            purchase histories from loyalty program members. The underlying concept of behavioral persistence entails an
            in-depth analysis of complementary cross-category purchase interdependencies at a segment level. The
            effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed procedure is demonstrated in a controlled field experiment
            involving targeting of several thousands of customers enrolled in the loyalty program of a ?do-it-yourself?
            retailer. Our empirical findings provide evidence of significant positive impacts on both profitability and
            sales for segment-specific tailored direct marketing campaigns.

        <number>MSR-TR-98-12</number>
        <abstract>Collaborative filtering or recommender systems use a database about user preferences to predict
            additional topics or products a new user might like. In this paper we describe several algorithms designed
            for this task, including techniques based on correlation coefficients, vector-based similarity calculations,
            and statistical Bayesian methods. We compare the predictive accuracy of the various methods in a set of
            representative problem domains. We use two basic classes of evaluation metrics. The first characterizes
            accuracy over a set of individual predictions in terms of average absolute deviation. The second estimates
            the utility of a ranked list of suggested items. This metric uses an estimate of the probability that a user
            will see a recommendation in an ordered list. Experiments were run for datasets associated with 3
            application areas, 4 experimental protocols, and the 2 evaluation metrics for the various algorithms.
            Results indicate that for a wide range of conditions, Bayesian networks with decision trees at each node and
            correlation methods outperform Bayesian-clustering and vector-similarity methods. Between correlation and
            Bayesian networks, the preferred method depends on the nature of the dataset, nature of the application
            (ranked versus one-by-one presentation), and the availability of votes with which to make predictions. Other
            considerations include the size of database, speed of predictions, and learning time.

        <title>Why Not Use Query Logs As Corpora?</title>
        <year>2004</year>
        <journal>Proceedings of the Ninth ESSLLI Student Session</journal>
        <abstract>Generally, every Web search engine logs the user sessions. These records, called query logs, contain
            valuable information about the behaviour of Internet users and their language. There are only a few
            experiments on mining query logs, but they confirm that query logs are very useful for designing natural
            language applications in Web retrieval. This paper shows how lexical and semantic information can be
            extracted from query logs using statistical methods. I first summarize approaches in query log processing
            and mining for different purposes. After a short description of the used query logs, I present new domain-
            and language-independent methods for generating a compound dictionary and extracting semantically similar
            terms. The evaluation will shed light on the quality of proposed methods and show that the results are good
            enough to be directly integrated in query processing and improve information retrieval on the Web.

            Information Scent

        <abstract>Web is a valuable source of information and it is expanding at an enormous speed. Search engines
            provide the interface to access to this vast pool of information. Users express their information need
            through the input query to retrieve the relevant information which does not prove to be effective as input
            query entered by the user is too short to get the information need of the user. To retrieve the information
            according to a particular information need from a big pool of information available on the web is a big
            challenge. This paper proposes a method to find the related queries which approximate the information need
            of the input query issued to the search engine. This is accomplished using Information scent and content of
            clicked pages in query sessions mining. Information scent is derived from the information foraging theory in
            which user behavior in the information environment is guided by information scent. Information need of the
            query sessions is modeled using information scent and content of clicked URLs and query sessions with
            similar information need are clustered. The clusters which closely approximate the information need of input
            query are used to suggest queries with similar information need for a given input query. The suggested
            queries are ranked in order of their degree of relevance with respect to information need of the input
            query. Retrieval precision of search engine is improved as suggested queries help to retrieve document
            relevant to the need of user efficiently and quickly. Experimental study has been conducted on the dataset
            collected from Google search engine Web history to confirm the improvement of precision of information
            retrieval.

        <year>2002</year>
        <abstract>Clustering is a division of data into groups of similar objects. Representing the data by fewer
            clusters neccessarily loses certain fine details, but achieves simplification. It models data by its
            clusters. Data modeling puts clustering in a historial perspective rooted in mathematics, statistics and
            numerical analysis. From a machine learning perspective clusters correspond to hidden patterns, the search
            for clusters in unsupervised learning and the resulting system represents a data concept....

        <abstract>The present work covers a comparison of the text retrieval performances of relational databases and IR
            Systems over a TREC-like test collection for Turkish. The effects of language specific preprocessing and
            different query lengths for different information retrieval systems are investigated. Showed that language
            specific preprocessing improves retrieval performance for all systems and also Relational Databases are
            slower with longer queries.

        <title>A Dynamic Conditional Random Field Model for Object Segmentation in Image Sequences</title>
        <year>2005</year>
        <journal>In IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2005)</journal>
        <abstract>This paper presents a dynamic conditional random field (DCRF) model to integrate contextual
            constraints for object segmentation in image sequences. Spatial and temporal dependencies within the
            segmentation process are unified by a dynamic probabilistic framework based on the conditional random field
            (CRF). An efficient approximate filtering algorithm is derived for the DCRF model to recursively estimate
            the segmentation field from the history of video frames. The segmentation method employs both intensity and
            motion cues, and it combines dynamic information and spatial interaction of the observed data. Experimental
            results show that the proposed approach effectively fuses contextual constraints in video sequences and
            improves the accuracy of object segmentation.

        <volume>Master of Science</volume>
        <abstract>This thesis explores a number of parameter estimation techniques for conditional random fields, a
            recently introduced probabilistic model for labelling and segmenting sequential data. Theoretical and
            practical disadvantages of the training techniques reported in current literature on CRFs are discussed. We
            hypothesise that general numerical optimisation techniques result in improved performance over iterative
            scaling algorithms for training CRFs. Experiments run on a subset of a well-known text chunking data set
            confirm that this is indeed the case. This is a highly promising result, indicating that such parameter
            estimation techniques make CRFs a practical and efficient choice for labelling sequential data, as well as a
            theoretically sound and principled probabilistic framework.

        <page>1401-1408</page>
        <journal>In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 17 (NIPS 2004)</journal>
        <abstract>We seek to both detect and segment objects in images. To exploit both local image data as well as
            contextual information, we introduce Boosted Random Fields (BRFs), which uses Boosting to learn the graph
            structure and local evidence of a conditional random field (CRF). The graph structure is learned by
            assembling graph fragments in an additive model. The connections between individual pixels are not very
            informative, but by using dense graphs, we can pool information from large regions of the image; dense
            models also support efficient inference. We show how contextual information from other objects can improve
            detection performance, both in terms of accuracy and speed, by using a computational cascade. We apply our
            system to detect stuff and things in office and street scenes.

        <title>Max Margin Markov Networks</title>
        <year>2004</year>
        <journal>In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 16 (NIPS 2003), 2004</journal>
        <abstract>In typical classification tasks, we seek a function which assigns a label to a single object.
            Kernel-based approaches, such as support vector machines (SVMs), which maximize the margin of confidence of
            the classifier, are the method of choice for many such tasks. Their popularity stems both from the ability
            to use high-dimensional feature spaces, and from their strong theoretical guarantees. However, many
            real-world tasks involve sequential, spatial, or structured data, where multiple labels must be assigned.
            Existing kernel-based methods ignore structure in the problem, assigning labels independently to each
            object, losing much useful information. Conversely, probabilistic graphical models, such as Markov networks,
            can represent correlations between labels, by exploiting problem structure, but cannot handle
            high-dimensional feature spaces, and lack strong theoretical generalization guarantees. In this paper, we
            present a new framework that combines the advantages of both approaches: Maximum margin Markov (M3) networks
            incorporate both kernels, which efficiently deal with high-dimensional features, and the ability to capture
            correlations in structured data. We present an efficient algorithm for learning M3 networks based on a
            compact quadratic program formulation. We provide a new theoretical bound for generalization in structured
            domains. Experiments on the task of handwritten character recognition and collective hypertext
            classification demonstrate very significant gains over previous approaches.

        <title>Conditional Models for Contextual Human Motion Recognition</title>
        <year>2005</year>
        <journal>In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision, (ICCV 2005)</journal>
        <abstract>We present algorithms for recognizing human motion in monocular video sequences, based on
            discriminative Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMM). Existing approaches
            to this problem typically use generative (joint) structures like the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Therefore
            they have to make simplifying, often unrealistic assumptions on the conditional independence of observations
            given the motion class labels and cannot accommodate overlapping features or long term contextual
            dependencies in the observation sequence. In contrast, conditional models like the CRFs seamlessly represent
            contextual dependencies, support efficient, exact inference using dynamic programming, and their parameters
            can be trained using convex optimization. We introduce conditional graphical models as complementary tools
            for human motion recognition and present an extensive set of experiments that show how these typically
            outperform HMMs in classifying not only diverse human activities like walking, jumping, running, picking or
            dancing, but also for discriminating among subtle motion styles like normal walk and wander walk.

        <abstract>Conditional random fields for sequence labeling offer advantages over both generative models like HMMs
            and classifers applied at each sequence position. Among sequence labeling tasks in language processing,
            shallow parsing has received much attention, with the development of standard evaluation datasets and
            extensive comparison among methods. We show here how to train a conditional random field to achieve
            performance as good as any reported base noun-phrase chunking method on the CoNLL task, and better than any
            reported single model. Improved training methods based on modern optimization algorithms were critical in
            achieving these results. We present extensive comparisons between models and training methods that confirm
            and strengthen previous results on shallow parsing and training methods for maximum-entropy models.

        <abstract>As the wealth of biomedical knowledge in the form of literature increases, there is a rising need for
            effective natural language processing tools to assist in organizing, curating, and retrieving this
            information. To that end, named entity recognition (the task of identifying words and phrases in free text
            that belong to certain classes of interest) is an important first step for many of these larger information
            management goals. In recent years, much attention has been focused on the problem of recognizing gene and
            protein mentions in biomedical abstracts. This paper presents a framework for simultaneously recognizing
            occurrences of PROTEIN, DNA, RNA, CELL-LINE, and CELL-TYPE entity classes using Conditional Random Fields
            with a variety of traditional and novel features. I show that this approach can achieve an overall F measure
            around 70, which seems to be the current state of the art.

        <title>Semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields for Information Extraction</title>
        <year>2005</year>
        <journal>In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 17 (NIPS 2004)</journal>
        <abstract>We describe semi-Markov conditional random fields (semi-CRFs), a conditionally trained version of
            semi-Markov chains. Intuitively, a semi-CRF on an input sequence x outputs a segmentation of x, in which
            labels are assigned to segments (i.e., subsequences) of x rather than to individual elements xi of x.
            Importantly, features for semi-CRFs can measure properties of segments, and transitions within a segment can
            be non-Markovian. In spite of this additional power, exact learning and inference algorithms for semi-CRFs
            are polynomial-time?often only a small constant factor slower than conventional CRFs. In experiments on five
            named entity recognition problems, semi-CRFs generally outperform conventional CRFs.

        <title>Discriminative Language Modeling with Conditional Random Fields and the Perceptron Algorithm</title>

        </journal>
        <abstract>This paper describes discriminative language modeling for a large vocabulary speech recognition task.
            We contrast two parameter estimation methods: the perceptron algorithm, and a method based on conditional
            random fields (CRFs). The models are encoded as deterministic weighted finite state automata, and are
            applied by intersecting the automata with word-lattices that are the output from a baseline recognizer. The
            perceptron algorithm has the benefit of automatically selecting a relatively small feature set in just a
            couple of passes over the training data. However, using the feature set output from the perceptron algorithm
            (initialized with their weights), CRF training provides an additional 0.5% reduction in word error rate, for
            a total 1.8% absolute reduction from the baseline of 39.2%.

        <abstract>We present a discriminative part-based approach for the recognition of object classes from unsegmented
            cluttered scenes. Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts conditioned on local observations
            found by an interest operator. For each object class the probability of a given assignment of parts to local
            features is modeled by a Conditional Random Field (CRF). We propose an extension of the CRF framework that
            incorporates hidden variables and combines class conditional CRFs into a unified framework for part-based
            object recognition. The parameters of the CRF are estimated in a maximum likelihood framework and
            recognition proceeds by finding the most likely class under our model. The main advantage of the proposed
            CRF framework is that it allows us to relax the assumption of conditional independence of the observed data
            (i.e. local features) often used in generative approaches, an assumption that might be too restrictive for a
            considerable number of object classes. We illustrate the potential of the model in the task of recognizing
            cars from rear and side views.

        <abstract>We propose Bayesian Conditional Random Fields (BCRFs) for classifying interdependent and structured
            data, such as sequences, images or webs. BCRFs are a Bayesian approach to training and inference with
            conditional random fields, which were previously trained by maximizing likelihood (ML) (Lafferty et al.,
            2001). Our framework eliminates the problem of overfitting, and offers the full advantages of a Bayesian
            treatment. Unlike the ML approach, we estimate the posterior distribution of the model parameters during
            training, and average over this posterior during inference. We apply an extension of EP method, the power EP
            method, to incorporate the partition function. For algorithmic stability and accuracy, we flatten the
            approximation structures to avoid two-level approximations. We demonstrate the superior prediction accuracy
            of BCRFs over conditional random fields trained with ML or MAP on synthetic and real datasets.

            Informaion Retrieval (SIGIR 2003)

        <abstract>The ability to find tables and extract information from them is a necessary component of data mining,
            question answering, and other information retrieval tasks. Documents often contain tables in order to
            communicate densely packed, multi-dimensional information. Tables do this by employing layout patterns to e
            ciently indicate fields and records in two-dimensional form. Their rich combination of formatting and
            content present di culties for traditional language modeling techniques, however. This paper presents the
            use of conditional random fields (CRFs) for table extraction, and compares them with hidden Markov models
            (HMMs). Unlike HMMs, CRFs support the use of many rich and overlapping layout and language features, and as
            a result, they perform significantly better. We show experimental results on plain-text government
            statistical reports in which tables are located with 92% F1, and their constituent lines are classified into
            12 table-related categories with 94% accuracy. We also discuss future work on undirected graphical models
            for segmenting columns, finding cells, and classifying them as data cells or label cells.

        <abstract>With the increasing use of research paper search engines, such as CiteSeer, for both literature search
            and hiring decisions, the accuracy of such systems is of paramount importance. This paper employs
            Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) for the task of extracting various common fields from the headers and
            citation of research papers. The basic theory of CRFs is becoming well-understood, but best-practices for
            applying them to real-world data requires additional exploration. This paper makes an empirical exploration
            of several factors, including variations on Gaussian, exponential and hyperbolic priors for improved
            regularization, and several classes of features and Markov order. On a standard benchmark data set, we
            achieve new state-of-the-art performance, reducing error in average F1 by 36%, and word error rate by 78% in
            comparison with the previous best SVM results. Accuracy compares even more favorably against HMMs.

        <abstract>Conditional random fields (CRFs) for sequence modeling have several advantages over joint models such
            as HMMs, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models, and the
            ability to incorporate arbitrary overlapping features. Previous work has focused on linear-chain CRFs, which
            correspond to finite-state machines, and have efficient exact inference algorithms. Often, however, we wish
            to label sequence data in multiple interacting ways?for example, performing part-of-speech tagging and noun
            phrase segmentation simultaneously, increasing joint accuracy by sharing information between them. We
            present dynamic conditional random fields (DCRFs), which are CRFs in which each time slice has a set of
            state variables and edges?a distributed state representation as in dynamic Bayesian networks?and parameters
            are tied across slices. (They could also be called conditionally-trained Dynamic Markov Networks.) Since
            exact inference can be intractable in these models, we perform approximate inference using the tree-based
            reparameterization framework (TRP). We also present empirical results comparing DCRFs with linear-chain CRFs
            on natural-language data.

        <title>Efficiently Inducing Features of Conditional Random Fields</title>
        <year>2003</year>
        <journal>In Proceedings of the Nineteenth Conference in Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI-03)
        </journal>
        <abstract>Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are undirected graphical models, a special case of which correspond
            to conditionally-trained finite state machines. A key advantage of CRFs is their great flexibility to
            include a wide variety of arbitrary, non-independent features of the input. Faced with this freedom,
            however, an important question remains: what features should be used? This paper presents an efficient
            feature induction method for CRFs. The method is founded on the principle of iteratively constructing
            feature conjunctions that would significantly increase conditional log-likelihood if added to the model.
            Automated feature induction enables not only improved accuracy and dramatic reduction in parameter count,
            but also the use of larger cliques, and more freedom to liberally hypothesize atomic input variables that
            may be relevant to a task. The method applies to linear-chain CRFs, as well as to more arbitrary CRF
            structures, such as Relational Markov Networks, where it corresponds to learning clique templates, and can
            also be understood as supervised structure learning. Experimental results on named entity extraction and
            noun phrase segmentation tasks are presented.

            induction to automatically construct the features that most increase conditional likelihood. In an effort to
            reduce overfitting, we use a combination of a Gaussian prior and early stopping based on the results of
            10-fold cross validation.

            stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in

            (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased
            towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for

        <abstract>Kernel conditional random fields (KCRFs) are introduced as a framework for discriminative modeling of
            graph-structured data. A representer theorem for conditional graphical models is given which shows how
            kernel conditional random fields arise from risk minimization procedures defined using Mercer kernels on
            labeled graphs. A procedure for greedily selecting cliques in the dual representation is then proposed,
            which allows sparse representations. By incorporating kernels and implicit feature spaces into conditional
            graphical models, the framework enables semi-supervised learning algorithms for structured data through the
            use of graph kernels. The framework and clique selection methods are demonstrated in synthetic data
            experiments, and are also applied to the problem of protein secondary structure prediction.

        <journal>In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 16 (NIPS 2003), 2004</journal>
        <abstract>In this paper we present Discriminative Random Fields (DRF), a discriminative framework for the
            classification of natural image regions by incorporating neighborhood spatial dependencies in the labels as
            well as the observed data. The proposed model exploits local discriminative models and allows to relax the
            assumption of conditional independence of the observed data given the labels, commonly used in the Markov
            Random Field (MRF) framework. The parameters of the DRF model are learned using penalized maximum
            pseudo-likelihood method. Furthermore, the form of the DRF model allows the MAP inference for binary
            classification problems using the graph min-cut algorithms. The performance of the model was verified on the
            synthetic as well as the real-world images. The DRF model outperforms the MRF model in the experiments.

        <journal>In Proceedings of the Nineteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2004)</journal>
        <abstract>Information Extraction methods can be used to automatically fill-in database forms from unstructured
            data such as Web documents or email. State-of-the-art methods have achieved low error rates but invariably
            make a number of errors. The goal of an interactive information extraction system is to assist the user in
            filling in database fields while giving the user confidence in the integrity of the data. The user is
            presented with an interactive interface that allows both the rapid verification of automatic field
            assignments and the correction of errors. In cases where there are multiple errors, our system takes into
            account user corrections, and immediately propagates these constraints such that other fields are often
            corrected automatically. Linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) have been shown to perform well for
            information extraction and other language modelling tasks due to their ability to capture arbitrary,
            overlapping features of the input in a Markov model. We apply this framework with two extensions: a
            constrained Viterbi decoding which finds the optimal field assignments consistent with the fields explicitly
            specified or corrected by the user; and a mechanism for estimating the confidence of each extracted field,
            so that low-confidence extractions can be highlighted. Both of these mechanisms are incorporated in a novel
            user interface for form filling that is intuitive and speeds the entry of data?providing a 23% reduction in
            error due to automated corrections.

        <abstract>We propose an approach to include contextual features for labeling images, in which each pixel is
            assigned to one of a finite set of labels. The features are incorporated into a probabilistic framework
            which combines the outputs of several components. Components differ in the information they encode. Some
            focus on the image-label mapping, while others focus solely on patterns within the label field. Components
            also differ in their scale, as some focus on fineresolution patterns while others on coarser, more global
            structure. A supervised version of the contrastive divergence algorithm is applied to learn these features
            from labeled image data. We demonstrate performance on two real-world image databases and compare it to a
            classifier and a Markov random field.

        <title>Using Conditional Random Fields to Predict Pitch Accents in Conversational Speech</title>
        <year>2004</year>

        </journal>
        <abstract>The detection of prosodic characteristics is an important aspect of both speech synthesis and speech
            recognition. Correct placement of pitch accents aids in more natural sounding speech, while automatic
            detection of accents can contribute to better word-level recognition and better textual understanding. In
            this paper we investigate probabilistic, contextual, and phonological factors that influence pitch accent
            placement in natural, conversational speech in a sequence labeling setting. We introduce Conditional Random
            Fields (CRFs) to pitch accent prediction task in order to incorporate these factors efficiently in a
            sequence model. We demonstrate the usefulness and the incremental effect of these factors in a sequence
            model by performing experiments on hand labeled data from the Switchboard Corpus. Our model outperforms the
            baseline and previous models of pitch accent prediction on the Switchboard Corpus.

        <title>Training Conditional Random Fields via Gradient Tree Boosting</title>
        <year>2004</year>
        <journal>In Proceedings of the Twenty-First International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2004)</journal>
        <abstract>Conditional Random Fields (CRFs; Lafferty, McCallum, &amp; Pereira, 2001) provide a flexible and
            powerful model for learning to assign labels to elements of sequences in such applications as part-of-speech
            tagging, text-to-speech mapping, protein and DNA sequence analysis, and information extraction from web
            pages. However, existing learning algorithms are slow, particularly in problems with large numbers of
            potential input features. This paper describes a new method for training CRFs by applying Friedman's (1999)
            gradient tree boosting method. In tree boosting, the CRF potential functions are represented as weighted
            sums of regression trees. Regression trees are learned by stage-wise optimizations similar to Adaboost, but
            with the objective of maximizing the conditional likelihood P(Y|X) of the CRF model. By growing regression
            trees, interactions among features are introduced only as needed, so although the parameter space is
            potentially immense, the search algorithm does not explicitly consider the large space. As a result,
            gradient tree boosting scales linearly in the order of the Markov model and in the order of the feature
            interactions, rather than exponentially like previous algorithms based on iterative scaling and gradient
            descent.

        <abstract>Statistical learning problems in many fields involve sequential data. This paper formalizes the
            principal learning tasks and describes the methods that have been developed within the machine learning
            research community for addressing these problems. These methods include sliding window methods, recurrent
            sliding windows, hidden Markov models, conditional random fields, and graph transformer networks. The paper
            also discusses some open research issues.

        <year>2005</year>
        <journal>Technical Report UM-CS-2005-028</journal>
        <abstract>Given a sequence of DNA nucleotide bases, the task of gene prediction is to find subsequences of bases
            that encode proteins. Reasonable performance on this task has been achieved using generatively trained
            sequence models, such as hidden Markov models. We propose instead the use of a discriminitively trained
            sequence model, the conditional random field (CRF). CRFs can naturally incorporate arbitrary,
            non-independent features of the input without making conditional independence assumptions among the
            features. This can be particularly important for gene finding, where including evidence from protein
            databases, EST data, or tiling arrays may improve accuracy. We eval- uate our model on human genomic data,
            and show that CRFs perform better than HMM-based models at incorporating homology evidence from protein
            databases, achieving a 10% reduction in base-level errors.

        <year>2005</year>
        <journal>In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 17 (NIPS 2004)</journal>
        <abstract>Many sequential prediction tasks involve locating instances of pat- terns in sequences. Generative
            probabilistic language models, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), have been successfully applied to many
            of these tasks. A limitation of these models however, is that they cannot naturally handle cases in which
            pattern instances overlap in arbitrary ways. We present an alternative approach, based on conditional Markov
            networks, that can naturally represent arbitrarily overlapping elements. We show how to efficiently train
            and perform inference with these models. Experimental results from a genomics domain show that our models
            are more accurate at locating instances of overlapping patterns than are baseline models based on HMMs.

        <year>2003</year>
        <journal>In Proceedings of 8th European Conference on Speech Communication and Technology (EuroSpeech)</journal>
        <abstract>Label sequence learning is the problem of inferring a state sequence from an observation sequence,
            where the state sequence may encode a labeling, annotation or segmentation of the sequence. In this paper we
            give an overview of discriminative methods developed for this problem. Special emphasis is put on large
            margin methods by generalizing multiclass Support Vector Machines and AdaBoost to the case of label
            sequences.An experimental evaluation demonstrates the advantages over classical approaches like Hidden
            Markov Models and the competitiveness with methods like Conditional Random Fields.

        <abstract>One of the most exciting accomplishments of computer science in the lifetime of this generation is the
            World Wide Web. The Web is a global electronic publishing medium. Its size has been growing with an enormous
            speed for over a decade. Most of its content is objectionable, but it also contains a huge amount of
            valuable information. The Web adds a new dimension to the concept of information explosion and tries to
            solve the very same problem by information retrieval systems known as Web search engines. We briefly review
            the information explosion problem and information retrieval systems, convey the past and state of the art in
            Turkish information retrieval research, illustrate some recent developments, and propose some future actions
            in this research area in Turkey.

        <abstract>Information retrieval (IR) has become an important application in today's computer world because of
            the great increase in the amount of web-based documents and the widespread use of the Internet. However, the
            classical bag of words approach no longer meets user expectations adequately. In this context, natural
            language processing (NLP) techniques come into mind. In this paper, we investigate the question of whether
            NLP techniques can improve the effectiveness of information retrieval in Turkish. We implemented and tested
            a linguistically motivated information retrieval system, which uses knowledge of the morphological,
            lexico-semantical and syntactical levels of Turkish.

        <abstract>In this study, we investigate information retrieval (IR) on Turkish texts using a large-scale test
            collection that contains 408,305 documents and 72 ad hoc queries. We examine the effects of several stemming
            options and query-document matching functions on retrieval performance. We show that a simple word
            truncation approach, a word truncation approach that uses language-dependent corpus statistics, and an
            elaborate lemmatizer-based stemmer provide similar retrieval effectiveness in Turkish IR. We investigate the
            effects of a range of search conditions on the retrieval performance; these include scalability issues,
            query and document length effects, and the use of stopword list in indexing.

        <abstract>This is an investigation of information retrieval performance of Turkish search engines with respect
            to precision, normalized recall, coverage and novelty ratios. We defined seventeen query topics for Arabul,
            Arama, Netbul and Superonline. These queries were carefully selected to assess the capability of a search
            engine for handling broad or narrow topic subjects, exclusion of particular information, identifying and
            indexing Turkish characters, retrieval of hub/authoritative pages, stemming of Turkish words, correct
            interpretation of Boolean operators. We classified each document in a retrieval output as being relevant or
            nonrelevant to calculate precision and normalized recall ratios at various cut-off points for each pair of
            query topic and search engine. We found the coverage and novelty ratios for each search engine. We also
            tested how search engines handle meta-tags and dead links. Arama appears to be the best Turkish search
            engine in terms of average precision and normalized recall ratios, and the coverage of Turkish sites.
            Turkish characters (and stemming as well) still cause bottlenecks for Turkish search engines. Superonline
            and Netbul make use of the indexing information in metatag fields to improve retrieval results.

        <abstract>This paper presents the design and the implementation of a morphological analyzer for Turkish. A new
            methodology is proposed for doing the analysis of Turkish words with an affix stripping approach and without
            using any lexicon. The rule-based and agglutinative structure of the language allows Turkish to be modeled
            with finite state machines (FSMs). In contrast to the previous works, in this study, FSMs are formed by
            using the morphotactic rules in reverse order. This paper describes the steps of this new methodology
            including the classification of the suffixes, the generation of the FSMs for each suffix class and their
            unification into a main machine to cooperate in the analysis.

        <abstract>FAQ (frequently-asked question) is a good question and answer model to realize business advisory
            system in restricted domain. A FAQ question answering system model is presented in this paper. With the help
            of the idea of ontology, a knowledge base is constructed in the domain. With the help of language KDML
            (Knowledge Database Mark-up Language) of HowNet,the domain ontology and the relationship of it are defined
            and described, and the fusion of domain knowledge base (domain HowNet) and common knowledge base(HowNet) is
            realized. On this basis, a question similarity calculation method, which makes use of the characteristics of
            the domain question and combines lexical relationship, syntactic interdependent relationship and the
            semantic relationship of domains among question sentences, is implemented. And based on the question
            similarity calculation, retrieval of related question from the candidate question set and extraction of
            answers can be implemented with this method. The result of Yunnan tourism question-answer model experiment
            shows that this method is feasible and effective.

        <abstract>Information distillation aims to extract the most useful pieces of information related to a given
            query from massive, possibly multilingual, audio and textual document sources. One critical component in a
            distillation engine is detecting sentences to be extracted from each relevant document. In this paper, we
            present a statistical sentence extraction approach for distillation. Basically, we frame this tack as a
            classification problem, where each candidate sentence in documents is classified as a relevant to the query
            or not. These documents may be textual or audio format and in a number of languages. For audio documents, we
            use both manual and automatic transcriptions, for non-English documents, we use automatic translations. In
            this work, we use AdaBoost, a discriminative classification method with both lexical and semantic features.
            The results indicate 11%-13% relative improvement over a baseline keyword-spotting-based approach. We also
            show the robustness of our method on the audio subset of the document sources using manual and automatic
            transcriptions

        <abstract>We present statistical models for morphological disambiguation in agglutinative languages, with a
            specific application to Turkish. Turkish presents an interesting problem for statistical models as the
            potential tag set size is very large because of the productive derivational morphology. We propose to handle
            this by breaking up the morhosyntactic tags into inflectional groups, each of which contains the
            inflectional features for each (intermediate) derived form. Our statistical models score the probability of
            each morhosyntactic tag by considering statistics over the individual inflectional groups and surface roots
            in trigram models. Among the four models that we have developed and tested, the simplest model ignoring the
            local morphotactics within words performs the best. Our best trigram model performs with 93.95% accuracy on
            our test data getting all the morhosyntactic and semantic features correct. If we are just interested in
            syntactically relevant features and ignore a very small set of semantic features, then the accuracy
            increases to 95.07%.

        <abstract>In this work we show how interactivity in a voice-enabled question answering application may improve
            speech recognition. We allow the user to provide a target named entity before asking the question. Then we
            build a named entity specific language model using the documents containing the named entity. The
            question-specific model is obtained by merging the named entity specific model with the model built on a set
            of questions. We present a set of experiments using the TREC question set on the AQUAINT corpus. The
            question-specific language model is compared with the baseline model built by merging a model of the AQUAINT
            corpus and past TREC questions. The question-specific model achieves 32.2% reduction in word error rate from
            the baseline using the questions where pronominal references are resolved.

        <abstract>This paper reports findings from an analysis of medical or health queries to different web search
            engines. We report results: (i). comparing samples of 10000 web queries taken randomly from 1.2 million
            query logs from the AlltheWeb.com and Excite.com commercial web search engines in 2001 for medical or health
            queries, (ii). comparing the 2001 findings from Excite and AlltheWeb.com users with results from a previous
            analysis of medical and health related queries from the Excite Web search engine for 1997 and 1999, and
            (iii). medical or health advice-seeking queries beginning with the word 'should'. Findings suggest: (i). a
            small percentage of web queries are medical or health related, (ii). the top five categories of medical or
            health queries were: general health, weight issues, reproductive health and puberty, pregnancy/obstetrics,
            and human relationships, and (iii). over time, the medical and health queries may have declined as a
            proportion of all web queries, as the use of specialized medical/health websites and e-commerce-related
            queries has increased. Findings provide insights into medical and health-related web querying and suggests
            some implications for the use of the general web search engines when seeking medical/health information.

        <abstract>Sexuality on the Internet takes many forms and channels, including chat rooms discussions, accessing
            Websites or searching Web search engines for sexual materials. The study of Web sexual queries provides
            insight into sexual-related information-seeking behavior, of value to Web users and providers alike. We
            qualitatively analyzed 58,027 queries from a log of 1,025,910 Excite Web user queries from 1999. We found
            that sexual and non-sexual-related queries exhibited differences in session duration, query outcomes, and
            search term choices. Implications for sexual information seeking and Web systems are discussed. [Copyright

        <abstract>Purpose - One of the most important dimensions of search engine user information seeking behaviour is
            content-based behaviour. One of the main elements in developing a personalised intelligent search engine is
            new topic identification. The purpose of this study is to perform automatic new topic identification in
            search engine transaction logs using conditional probabilities of new topic arrivals.
            Design/methodology/approach - Sample data logs from FAST (currently owned by Yahoo!) and Excite (currently
            owned by IAC Search &amp; Media) are used in the study. Conditional probabilities of new topic arrivals and
            topic continuations given query category are used to estimate new topic arrivals. Findings - The findings of
            this study show that the conditional probability approach reduced overestimation of topic shifts, increasing
            some performance measures to their highest ever value compared to previous studies. A straightforward
            procedure such as the conditional probability approach can be as successful as, and for some measures more
            successful than, more complex methods applied in previous automatic new topic identification studies.
            Originality/value - A straightforward procedure that can enable fast automatic new topic identification, a
            problem not yet solved, and an important step towards personalised search engines. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

        <abstract>Purpose - This study aims to propose an artificial neural network to identify automatically topic
            changes in a user session by using the statistical characteristics of queries, such as time intervals and
            query reformulation patterns. Design/methodology/approach - A sample data log from the Norwegian search
            engine FAST (currently owned by Overture) is selected to train the neural network and then the neural
            network is used to identify topic changes in the data log. Findings - A total of 98.4 percent of topic
            shifts and 86.6 percent of topic continuations were estimated correctly. Originality/value - Content
            analysis of search engine user queries is an important task, since successful exploitation of the content of
            queries can result in the design of efficient information retrieval algorithms for search engines, which can
            offer custom-tailored services to the web user. Identification of topic changes within a user search session
            is a key issue in the content analysis of search engine user queries. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

        <abstract>Based on analysis of very large Web query data sets with more than 1 million queries each, reports
            findings on Web multimedia searching by the Excite and FAST search engines in 2001. Finds that: (1) some
            differences exist between the Excite and FAST multimedia Web searches; (2) FAST users submit more multimedia
            queries but fewer audio-related queries; (3) FAST users take more time with queries and sessions compared
            with Excite users, but spend less time on audio queries; and (4) Excite users submit longer and more complex
            queries than FAST users. Since the Excite search engine is US-based and the FAST search engine Norway-based,
            concludes that some differences in the Web search behavior can be attributed to differences between US and
            European users. Proceeding Published by Information Today, Inc., 2002

        <abstract>Understanding Web searching behavior is important in developing more successful and cost-efficient Web
            search engines. We provide results from a comparative time-based Web study of US-based Excite and
            Norwegian-based Fast Web search logs, exploring variations in user searching related to changes in time of
            the day. Findings suggest: (1) fluctuations in Web user behavior over the day, (2) user investigations of
            query results are much longer, and submission of queries and number of users are much higher in the
            mornings, and (3) some query characteristics, including terms per query and query reformulation, remain
            steady throughout the day. Implications and further research are discussed. [Copyright 2004 Elsevier]

        <abstract>Multimedia is proliferating on Web sites, as the Web continues to enhance the integration of
            multimedia and textual information. In this paper we examine trends in multimedia Web searching by Excite
            users from 1997 to 2001. Results from an analysis of 1,025,910 Excite queries from 2001 are compared to
            similar Excite datasets from 1997 to 1999. Findings include: (1) queries per multimedia session have
            decreased since 1997 as a proportion of general queries due to the introduction of multimedia buttons near
            the query box, (2) multimedia queries identified are longer than non-multimedia queries, and (3) audio
            queries are more prevalent than image or video queries in identified multimedia queries. Overall, we see
            multimedia Web searching undergoing major changes as Web content and searching evolves. [Copyright 2003

        <abstract>Purpose -- Identification of topic changes within a user search session is a key issue in content
            analysis of search engine user queries. Recently, various studies have focused on new topic
            identification/session identification of search engine transaction logs, and several problems regarding the
            estimation of topic shifts and continuations were observed in these studies. This study aims to analyze the
            reasons for the problems that were encountered as a result of applying automatic new topic identification.
            Design/methodology/approach -- Measures, such as cleaning the data of common words and analyzing the errors
            of automatic new topic identification, are applied to eliminate the problems in estimating topic shifts and
            continuations. Findings -- The findings show that the resulting errors of automatic new topic identification
            have a pattern, and further research is required to improve the performance of automatic new topic
            identification. Originality/value -- Improving the performance of automatic new topic identification would
            be valuable to search engine designers, so that they can develop new clustering and query recommendation
            algorithms, as well as custom-tailored graphical user interfaces for search engine users. [ABSTRACT FROM

        <abstract>The purpose of this study is to provide automatic new topic identification of search engine query
            logs, and estimate the effect of statistical characteristics of search engine queries on new topic
            identification. By applying multiple linear regression and multi-factor ANOVA on a sample data log from the
            Excite search engine, we demonstrated that the statistical characteristics of Web search queries, such as
            time interval, search pattern and position of a query in a user session, are effective on shifting to a new
            topic. Multiple linear regression is also a successful tool for estimating topic shifts and continuations.
            The findings of this study provide statistical proof for the relationship between the non-semantic
            characteristics of Web search queries and the occurrence of topic shifts and continuations. [Copyright 2006

        <abstract>The purpose of this study is to provide results from experiments designed to investigate the
            cross-validation of an artificial neural network application to automatically identify topic changes in Web
            search engine user sessions by using data logs of different Web search engines for training and testing the
            neural network. Sample data logs from the FAST and Excite search engines are used in this study. The results
            of the study show that identification of topic shifts and continuations on a particular Web search engine
            user session can be achieved with neural networks that are trained on a different Web search engine data
            log. Although FAST and Excite search engine users differ with respect to some user characteristics (e.g.,
            number of queries per session, number of topics per session), the results of this study demonstrate that
            both search engine users display similar characteristics as they shift from one topic to another during a
            single search session. The key finding of this study is that a neural network that is trained on a selected
            data log could be universal; that is, it can be applicable on all Web search engine transaction logs
            regardless of the source of the training data log. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

        <abstract>The analysis of contextual information in search engine query logs enhances the understanding of Web
            users' search patterns. Obtaining contextual information on Web search engine logs is a difficult task,
            since users submit few number of queries, and search multiple topics. Identification of topic changes within
            a search session is an important branch of search engine user behavior analysis. The purpose of this study
            is to investigate the properties of a specific topic identification methodology in detail, and to test its
            validity. The topic identification algorithm's performance becomes doubtful in various cases. These cases
            are explored and the reasons underlying the inconsistent performance of automatic topic identification are
            investigated with statistical analysis and experimental design techniques. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

        <abstract>This article presents a dependency parsing scheme using an extended finite-state approach. The parser
            augments input representation with channels so that links representing syntactic dependency relations among
            words can be accommodated and iterates on the input a number of times to arrive at a fixed point.
            Intermediate configurations violating various constraints of projective dependency representations such as
            no crossing links and no independent items except sentential head are filtered via finite-state filters. We
            have applied the parser to dependency parsing of Turkish.

        <abstract>Zipf law of burstiness of content words is being less studied than his laws that describe the relation
            between the rank and the frequency of words. Zipf counted the number of intervals of the same length between
            the repetitions of the words belonging to the same frequency class and on a 260,000 word English corpus
            empirically showed that the interval size, I, between each occurrence of a word is inversely proportional to
            the number of intervals having that size: F a I p, where p varied between 1 and 1.3. In this study we
            investigated the validity of the law of burstiness on a Turkish corpus of size 55,000 and found p varying
            between 0.5 and 0.8.

        <abstract>Understanding multi-party meetings involves tasks such as dialog act segmentation and tagging, action
            item extraction, and summarization. In this paper we introduce a new task for multi-party meetings:
            extracting question/answer pairs. This is a practical application for further processing such as
            summarization. We propose a method based on discriminative classification of individual sentences as
            questions and answers via lexical, speaker, and dialog act tag information, followed by a contextual
            optimization via Markov models. Our results indicate that it is possible to outperform a non-trivial
            baseline using dialog act tag information. More specifically, our method achieves a 13% relative improvement
            over the baseline for the task of detecting answers in meetings.

        <abstract>Zipf's law-of-meaning states that the number of meanings of a word is related to its frequency. Words
            that are seen more frequently tend to have more meanings than the ones that are seen less frequently. This
            law, like the other Zipfian laws is consistent with the principal of least effort. In this study we hope to
            establish a basis for the number of meanings a word can attain in Turkish with respect to its frequency in a
            document. Zipfian parameters are derived from two Turkish corpora on which the meanings are labeled. It is
            hoped that the results of this study contributes in resolving ambiguity of word senses in Turkish.

        <abstract>Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) may result from several
            clinic situations and carries high morbidity and mortality risk, particularly in intensive care unit
            patients. The clinical spectrum changes from splanchnic hypoperfusion and intestinal ischemia to multiple
            organ failure. Previous studies demonstrated that serum D-lactate levels may be an early indicator in
            intestinal ischemia. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between intestinal ischemia and serum
            D-lactate levels during experimental IAH. Thirty-two male Wistar Albino rats weighing 250+/-50 g were
            divided into four groups. Three different intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) levels supplied by placement of an
            intraperitoneal Peritofix catheter and iso-osmotic polyethylene glycol infusion. Each of the IAP levels (15,
            20, and 25 mm Hg groups) was checked with the monitor system and fixed for an hour. Control-group animals
            were not subjected to increased IAP. One hour later, 5-ml blood samples were taken for measurement of serum
            D-lactate levels and 2-cm intestinal tissue samples were taken 5 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve for
            histopathologic examination. Elevated serum D-lactate levels were recorded in animals with higher IAP
            levels.There was a positive correlation between serum D-lactate levels and IAP levels. Histological
            examinations of the intestinal tissue samples showed no significant pathologic changes in concordance with
            intestinal ischemia. Serum D-lactate levels may be an early indicator for increased IAP pressure before
            intestinal ischemic changes occur.

        <abstract>We propose a framework of e-learning FAQ (frequently asked questions) retrieval system by applying
            hierarchical agglomerative clustering method and rough set theory. We try to provide a possible solution to
            improve the learning performance of e-Learning system. The clustering method and FAQ collection are used to
            construct a FAQ clustering concept hierarchy. Then, we use lower/upper approximations in rough set theory to
            classify userspsila queries. The rough set theory can help solve uncertain problem well. Finally, the
            relevant FAQs for the user query are generated. The relevant FAQs are those in the cluster to which the user
            query is assigned.

        <abstract>The technology underlying text search engines has advanced dramatically in the past decade. The
            development of a family of new index representations has led to a wide range of innovations in index
            storage, index construction, and query evaluation. While some of these developments have been consolidated
            in textbooks, many specific techniques are not widely known or the textbook descriptions are out of date. In
            this tutorial, we introduce the key techniques in the area, describing both a core implementation and how
            the core can be enhanced through a range of extensions. We conclude with a comprehensive bibliography of
            text indexing literature.

        <abstract>Identifying sentence boundaries is an indispensable task for most natural language processing (NLP)
            systems. While extensive efforts have been devoted to mine biomedical text using NLP techniques, few
            attempts are specifically targeted at disambiguating sentence boundaries in biomedical literature, which has
            a number of unique features that can reduce the accuracy of algorithms designed for general English genre
            significantly. In order to increase the accuracy of sentence boundary identification for biomedical
            literature, we developed a method using a combination of heuristic and statistical strategies. Our approach
            does not require part-of-speech taggers or training procedures. Experiments with biomedical test corpora
            show our system significantly outperforms existing sentence boundary determination algorithms, particularly
            for full text biomedical literature. Our system is very fast and it should also be easily adaptable for
            sentence boundary determination in scientific literature from non-biomedical fields.

        <abstract>This article compares the word frequencies of the few most common words in Spanish as revealed by a
            modern corpus of over five thousand words with a corpus of Golden-Age Spanish texts of over a million words,
            and finds that although de is by far the most common word in contemporary Spanish, in the 16(th) and 17(th)
            Centuries it was considerably less frequent, and in many texts was less frequent than y, or que for which
            shared very similar frequency figures. It is argued that this significant change in the Spanish language
            comes about in the 20(th) Century.

        <abstract>The question of whether Dutch listeners rely on the rhythmic characteristics of their native language
            to segment speech was investigated in three experiments. In Experiment 1, listeners were induced to make
            missegmentations of continuous speech. The results showed that word boundaries were inserted before strong
            syllables and deleted before weak syllables. In Experiment 2, listeners were required to spot real CVC or
            CVCC words (C = consonant, V = vowel) embedded in bisyllabic nonsense strings. For CVCC words, fewer errors
            were made when the second syllable of the nonsense string was weak rather than strong, whereas for CVC words
            the effect was reversed. Experiment 3 ruled out an acoustic explanation for this effect. It is argued that
            these results are in line with an account in which both metrical segmentation and lexical competition play a
            role.

        <abstract>Authorship attribution supported by statistical or computational methods has a long history starting
            from the 19th century and is marked by the seminal study of Mosteller and Wallace (1964) on the authorship
            of the disputed Federalist Papers. During the last decade, this scientific field has been developed
            substantially, taking advantage of research advances in areas such as machine learning, information
            retrieval, and natural language processing. The plethora of available electronic texts (e.g., e-mail
            messages, online forum messages, blogs, source code, etc.) indicates a wide variety of applications of this
            technology, provided it is able to handle short and noisy text from multiple candidate authors. In this
            article, a survey of recent advances of the automated approaches to attributing authorship is presented,
            examining their characteristics for both text representation and text classification. The focus of this
            survey is on computational requirements and settings rather than on linguistic or literary issues. We also
            discuss evaluation methodologies and criteria for authorship attribution studies and list open questions
            that will attract future work in this area.

        <abstract>Most document recognition work to date has been performed on English text. Because of the large
            overlap of the character sets found in English and major Western European languages such as French and
            German, some extensions of the basic English capability to those languages have taken place. However,
            automatic language identification prior to optical character recognition is not commonly available and adds
            utility to such systems. Languages and their scripts have attributes that make it possible to determine the
            language of a document automatically. Detection of the values of these attributes requires the recognition
            of particular features of the document image and, in the case of languages using Latin-based symbols, the
            character syntax of the underlying language. We have developed techniques for distinguishing which language
            is represented in an image of text. This work is restricted to a small but important subset of the world's
            languages. The method first classifies the script into two broad classes: Han-based and Latin-based. This
            classification is based on the spatial relationships of features related to the upward concavities in
            character structures. Language identification within the Han script class (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) is
            performed by analysis of the distribution of optical density in the text images. We handle 23 Latin-based
            languages using a technique based on character shape codes, a representation of Latin text that is
            inexpensive to compute.

        <abstract>Web search engine users normally enter a series of short Boolean queries. Some Web search services
            such as Ask Jeeves request users to enter queries in the form of questions. Reports findings from a study
            conducted to examine the nature of queries submitted to Ask Jeeves, a publicly accessible question and
            answer (Q&amp;A) search engine. Analyzes about 30,000 queries from a dataset of 800,000 queries. Results
            include: (1) many queries are not in question format; (2) four types of user queries: keyword, Boolean,
            question, and request; (3) common formats for question and request queries. Concludes that these findings
            provide an initial mapping of the structure and content of queries made of Q&amp;A systems. Proceeding

        <abstract>Queries are the primary means of translating a Web user's information needs in a way that Web systems
            can process. Web queries are as varied as the range of human interest areas, including sexual information
            seeking. A portion of Web queries is sexually related. Reports results of a study of sexually-related
            queries, aiming to provide insight into human sexual information-seeking behavior for use by Web system
            developers. Extracts 116,050 sexually-related queries from a query log of 1,025,910 Excite user queries.
            Finds that many aspects of sexual and non-sexually-related queries exhibit significant differences in terms
            of duration of the session, analysis of the results of each query, and search term usage. Discusses the
            implications of the findings. Proceeding Published by Information Today, Inc., 2001

        <title>Features for word spotting in historical manuscripts</title>

        <abstract>For the transition from traditional to digital libraries, the large number of handwritten manuscripts
            that exist pose a great challenge. Easy access to such collections requires an index, which is currently
            created manually at great cost. Because automatic handwriting recognizers fail on historical manuscripts,
            the word spotting technique has been developed: the words in a collection are matched as images and grouped
            into clusters which contain all instances of the same word. By annotating interesting clusters, an index
            that links words to the locations where they occur can be built automatically. Due to the noise in
            historical documents, selecting the right features for matching words is crucial. We analyzed a range of
            features suitable for matching words using dynamic time warping (DTW), which aligns and compares sets of
            features extracted from two images. Each feature's individual performance was measured on a test set. With
            arc average precision of 72%, a combination of features outperforms competing techniques in speed and
            precision.

        <abstract>Libraries and other institutions are interested in providing access to scanned versions of their large
            collections of handwritten historical manuscripts on electronic media. Convenient access to a collection
            requires an index, which is manually created at great labour and expense. Since current handwriting
            recognizers do not perform well on historical documents, a technique called word spotting has been
            developed: clusters with occurrences of the same word in a collection are established using image matching.
            By annotating interesting clusters, an index can be built automatically. We present an algorithm for
            matching handwritten words in noisy historical documents. The segmented word images are preprocessed to
            create sets of 1-dimensional features, which are then compared using dynamic time warping. We present
            experimental results on two different data sets from the George Washington collection. Our experiments show
            that this algorithm performs better and is faster than competing matching techniques.

        <abstract>In this paper we present a method based on Hidden Markov Random Fields and 2D dynamic programming
            image decoding, for segmenting pages of complex handwritten manuscripts such as novelist drafts. After a

            on the drafts of the French novelist Gustave Flaubert.

            Dutch and German, we found improvements to be around 25% for German and as much as 69% for Dutch. For
            Italian, lexicon-based stemming resulted in gains of up to 25%.

        <title>A scale space approach for automatically segmenting words from historical handwritten documents</title>

        <volume>27</volume>
        <abstract>Many libraries, museums, and other organizations contain large collections of handwritten historical
            documents, for example, the papers of early presidents like George Washington at the Library of Congress.
            The first step in providing recognition/retrieval tools is to automatically segment handwritten pages into
            words. State of the art segmentation techniques like the gap metrics algorithm have been mostly developed
            and tested on highly constrained documents like bank checks and postal addresses. There has been little work
            on full handwritten pages and this work has usually involved testing on clean artificial documents created
            for the purpose of research. Historical manuscript images, on the other hand, contain a great deal of noise
            and are much more challenging. Here, a novel scale space algorithm for automatically segmenting handwritten
            ( historical) documents into words is described. First, the page is cleaned to remove margins. This is
            followed by a gray-level projection profile algorithm for finding lines in images. Each line image is then
            filtered with an anisotropic Laplacian at several scales. This procedure produces blobs which correspond to
            portions of characters at small scales and to words at larger scales. Crucial to the algorithm is scale
            selection, that is, finding the optimum scale at which blobs correspond to words. This is done by finding
            the maximum over scale of the extent or area of the blobs. This scale maximum is estimated using three
            different approaches. The blobs recovered at the optimum scale are then bounded with a rectangular box to
            recover the words. A postprocessing filtering step is performed to eliminate boxes of unusual size which are
            unlikely to correspond to words. The approach is tested on a number of different data sets and it is shown
            that, on 100 sampled documents from the George Washington corpus of handwritten document images, a total
            error rate of 17 percent is observed. The technique outperforms a state-of-the-art gap metrics
            word-segmentation algorithm on this collection.

        <abstract>Most of existing text clustering algorithms use the vector space model, which treats documents as bags
            of words. Thus, word sequences in the documents are ignored, while the meaning of natural languages strongly
            depends on them. In this paper, we propose two new text clustering algorithms, named Clustering based on
            Frequent Word Sequences (CFWS) and Clustering based on Frequent Word Meaning Sequences (CFWMS). A word is
            the word form showing in the document, and a word meaning is the concept expressed by synonymous word forms.
            A word (meaning) sequence is frequent if it occurs in more than certain percentage of the documents in the
            text database. The frequent word (meaning) sequences can provide compact and valuable information about
            those text documents. For experiments, we used the Reuters-21578 text collection, CISI documents of the
            Classic data set [Classic data set, ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/smart/], and a corpus of the Text Retrieval
            Conference (TREC) [High Accuracy Retrieval from Documents (HARD) Track of Text Retrieval Conference, 2004].
            Our experimental results show that CFWS and CFWMS have much better clustering accuracy than Bisecting
            k-means (BKM) [M. Steinbach, G. Karypis, V. Kumar, A Comparison of Document Clustering Techniques, KDD-2000

        <number>3</number>
        <volume>21</volume>
        <abstract>This paper proposes a new approach for acquiring morpho-lexical probabilities from an untagged corpus.
            This approach demonstrates a way to extract very useful and nontrivial information from an untagged corpus,
            which otherwise would require laborious tagging of large corpora. The paper describes the use of these
            morpho-lexical probabilities as an information source for morphological disambiguation in Hebrew. The
            suggested method depends primarily on the following property: a lexical entry in Hebrew may have many
            different word forms, some of which are ambiguous and some of which are nor. Thus, the disambiguation of a
            given word can be achieved using other word forms of the same lexical entry. Even though it was originally
            devised and implemented for dealing with the morphological ambiguity problem in Hebrew, the basic idea can
            be extended and used to handle similar problems in other languages with rich morphology.

        <abstract>There are several recent studies that propose search output clustering as an alternative
            representation method to ranked output. Users are provided with cluster representations instead of lists of
            titles and invited to make decisions on groups of documents. This paper discusses the difficulties involved
            in representing clusters for users' evaluation in a concise but easily interpretable form. The discussion is
            based on findings and user feedback from a user study investigating the effectiveness of search output
            clustering. The overall impression created by the experiment results and users' feedback is that clusters
            cannot be relied on to consistently produce meaningful document groups that can easily be recognised by the
            users. They also seem to lead to unrealistic user expectations. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

        <abstract>Morphology is the area of linguistics concerned with the internal structure of words. Information
            retrieval has generally not paid much attention to word structure, other than to account for some of the
            variability in word forms via the use of stemmers. We report on our experiments to determine the importance
            of morphology, and the effect that it has on performance. We found that grouping morphological variants
            makes a significant improvement in retrieval performance. Improvements are seen by grouping inflectional as
            well as derivational variants. We also found that performance was enhanced by recognizing lexical phrases.
            We describe the interaction between morphology and lexical ambiguity, and how resolving that ambiguity will
            lead to further improvements in performance. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

        <abstract>Inductively coupled plasma systems are appropriate equipments for the spheroidization processes of
            powder materials because they have large volumes, high purities, and axial powder injection properties.
            Especially the long residence times of powders inside the plasma in the reactor are another advantage of
            ICTPs. The fundamentals of the production of spherical ceramic powders via inductively coupled thermal
            plasma systems include melting process of powders in the plasma jet and free falling of them through the
            reactor. This theoretical study was made as groundwork of the planned study by an inductively coupled
            thermal plasma system. A theoretical study was made on spheroidization of powders via thermal plasma
            systems. In the study, nonlinear momentum and energy equations were numerically solved through a computer
            code written in FORTRAN. The effects of plasma gas temperature and velocity, nozzle and particle diameter,
            initial particle temperature and velocity, and the volume flow rate of plasma gas on particle temperature
            and velocity were investigated in the analysis. The results obtained via the fifth order Runge-Kutta method
            were given as diagrams.

        <abstract>The majority of information retrieval experiments are evaluated by measures such as average precision
            and average recall. Fundamental decisions about the superiority of one retrieval technique over another are
            made solely on the basis of these measures. We claim that average performance figures need to be validated
            with a careful statistical analysis and that there is a great deal of additional information that can be
            uncovered by looking closely at the results of individual queries. This article is a case study of stemming
            algorithms which describes a number of novel approaches to evaluation and demonstrates their value.

        <title>Analysis of the flow field induced by the sessile peritrichous ciliate Opercularia asymmetrica</title>

        <abstract>The feeding mechanism of the sessile protozoon Opercularia asymmetrica (Oligohymenophorea,
            Peritrichia) relies on the cilia beat generating a flow field that convectively transports suspended
            particles and dissolved substances to the oral cavity of the organism. By use of optical micro-flow
            measurement and theoretical methods the flow environment of two neighbouring peritrichous ciliate cells is
            studied. Both, yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and artificial flow tracers are used for the
            visualisation of the flow field. Artificial tracers are rejected by the protozoa and deviate from the fluid
            path lines, while yeast cells follow the flow almost perfectly. This is shown through a dimensional analysis
            of the involved hydrodynamic forces on the tracers. The measured flow field exhibits maximum velocities of
            25 microm/s at around 20 microm distance ahead of an individual ciliate. The flow field extends 200 microm
            from the location of the ciliate. A nicking motion of the protozoon is observed and found not to obey any
            periodic law. Multiples of protozoa exhibit most commonly an alternating cilia beat regime generating a
            non-stationary flow field. It can be shown through theoretical methods that fluid exchange is enhanced in
            this alternating regime compared to a flow field generated by a single ciliate. Fluid exchange depends on
            the distance of the ciliates from each other and on the alteration frequency of the cilia beat. The
            comparison of an analytical Stokes' flow solution with the observed fluid flow serves to determine the force
            required to maintain the flow field against viscous dissipation. The force magnitude is in the order of
            magnitude of 10-100 pN.

        <abstract>We present a family of scale-invariant local shape features formed by chains of k connected roughly
            straight contour segments (kAS), and their use for object class detection. kAS are able to cleanly encode
            pure fragments of an object boundary without including nearby clutter. Moreover, they offer an attractive
            compromise between information content and repeatability and encompass a wide variety of local shape
            structures. We also define a translation and scale invariant descriptor encoding the geometric configuration
            of the segments within a kAS, making kAS easy to reuse in other frameworks, for example, as a replacement or
            addition to interest points (IPs). Software for detecting and describing kAS is released at
            http://lear.inrialpes.fr/software. We demonstrate the high performance of kAS within a simple but powerful
            sliding-window object detection scheme. Through extensive evaluations, involving eight diverse object
            classes and more than 1,400 images, we 1) study the evolution of performance as the degree of feature
            complexity k varies and determine the best degree, 2) show that kAS substantially outperform IPs for
            detecting shape-based classes, and 3) compare our object detector to the recent state-of-the-art system by
            Dalal and Triggs [4].

        <title>Three-dimensional numerical approach to investigate the substrate transport and conversion in an

        <abstract>This numerical study evaluates the momentum and mass transfer in an immobilized enzyme reactor. The
            simulation is based on the solution of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation and a scalar transport
            equation with a sink term for the transport and the conversion of substrate to product. The reactor consists
            of a container filled with 20 spherical enzyme carriers. Each of these carriers is covered with an active
            enzyme layer where the conversion takes place. To account for the biochemical activity, the sink term in the
            scalar transport equation is represented by a standard Michaelis-Menten approach. The simulation gives
            detailed information of the local substrate and product concentrations with respect to external and internal
            transport limitations. A major focus is set on the influence of the substrate transport velocity on the
            catalytic process. For reactor performance analysis the overall and the local transport processes are
            described by a complete set of dimensionless variables. The interaction between substrate concentration,
            velocity, and efficiency of the process can be studied with the help of these variables. The effect of
            different substrate inflow concentrations on the process can be seen in relation to velocity variations. The
            flow field characterization of the system makes it possible to understand fluid mechanical properties and
            its importance to transport processes. The distribution of fluid motion through the void volume has
            different properties in different parts of the reactor. This phenomenon has strong effects on the
            arrangement of significantly different mass transport areas as well as on process effectiveness. With the
            given data it is also possible to detect zones of high, low, and latent enzymatic activity and to determine
            whether the conversion is limited due to mass transfer or reaction resistances.

        <abstract>Two types of techniques are usually adopted in language differentiation: token matching and

            When applied to more than 23 languages, it has proved to be effective in classifying documents printed in

        <abstract>In this paper, we describe a solution method for sentence boundary detection in Turkish. The method
            exploits simple heuristic knowledge of Turkish syllabication and its phonetic rules for disambiguation of
            dots. The test accuracy of the algorithm is measured as 96.02%. The main contribution of this study is
            considered as presenting a new lexicon free method for differentiating EOS (end of sentence) dots from the
            ones that are used for other purposes.

        <abstract>Five language and tagset independent stochastic taggers, handling morphological and contextual
            information, are presented and tested in corpora of seven European languages (Dutch, English, French,
            German, Creek, Italian and Spanish), using two sets of grammatical tags; a small set containing the eleven
            main grammatical classes and a large set of grammatical categories common to all languages. The unknown
            words are tagged using an experimentally proven stochastic hypothesis that links the stochastic behavior of
            the unknown words with that of the less probable known words. A fully automatic training and tagging program
            has been implemented on an IBM PC-compatible 80386-based computer. Measurements of error rate, time
            response, and memory requirements have shown that the taggers' performance is satisfactory, even though a
            small training text is available. The error rate is improved when new texts are used to update the
            stochastic model parameters.

        <abstract>Although Turkish is a significant language with over 60 million native speakers, its cryptographic
            characteristics are relatively unknown. In this paper, some language patterns and frequencies of Turkish
            (such as letter frequency profile, letter contact patterns, most frequent digrams, trigrams and words,
            common word beginnings and endings, vowel/consonant patterns, etc.) relevant to information security,
            cryptography and plaintext recognition applications are presented and discussed. The data is collected from
            a large Turkish corpus and the usage of the data is illustrated through cryptanalysis of a mono-alphabetic
            substitution cipher. A new vowel identification method is developed using a distinct pattern of
            Turkish-(almost) non-existence of double consonants at word boundaries.

            statistics of Turkish were calculated by using this corpus. Frequencies of most frequently used first 7
            words were compared with their equivalent in English, and it was found out that most frequently used words
            are not nouns in natural languages Most frequently used words having 1 to 5 letters were determined and they
            were applied onto a randomly selected text in order to test the validity of the process.

        <volume>1634</volume>
        <abstract>We consider the task of tagging Slovene words with morphosyntactic descriptions (MSDs). MSDs contain
            not only part-of-speech information but also attributes such as gender and case. In the case of Slovene
            there are 2,083 possible MSDs. P-Progol was used to learn morphosyntactic disambiguation rules from
            annotated data (consisting of 161,314 examples) produced by the MULTEXT-East project. P-Progol produced
            1,148 rules taking 36 hours. Using simple grammatical background knowledge, e.g. looking for case
            disagreement, P-Progol induced 4,094 clauses in eight parallel runs. These rules have proved effective at
            detecting and explaining incorrect MSD annotations in an independent test set, but have not so far produced
            a tagger comparable to other existing taggers in terms of accuracy.

        <abstract>To calculate some statistical properties of a language, first you need to take some samples of that
            language. That sample is called a corpus. An unbalanced large scale Turkish text corpus (TurCo) having
            [similar to] 362 MB capacity and more than 50 million words was prepared by using 12 different resources
            including web sites and novels in Turkish language. Different algorithms were tested to obtain the n-gram (1
            [less-than or equal to] n [less-than or equal to] 5) values. Efficiencies of different algorithms have been
            examined by applying them onto the each piece of the corpus one by one. Only detailed results of the two
            algorithms created without using database tables are given, because all the other algorithms need to run
            more than one day which makes those tests inefficient.

        <number>1</number>
        <volume>38</volume>
        <abstract>This study investigates the writing style change of two Turkish authors, Cetin Altan and Yasar Kemal,
            in their old and new works using respectively their newspaper columns and novels. The style markers are the
            frequencies of word lengths in both text and vocabulary, and the rate of usage of most frequent words. For
            both authors, t-tests and logistic regressions show that the length of the words in new works is
            significantly longer than that of the old. The principal component analyses graphically illustrate the
            separation between old and new texts. The works are correctly categorized as old or new with 75 to 100%
            accuracy and 92% average accuracy using discriminant analysis-based cross validation. The results imply
            higher time gap may have positive impact in separation and categorization. For Altan a regression analysis
            demonstrates a decrease in average word length as the age of his column increases. One interesting
            observation is that for one word each author has similar preference changes over time.

        <title>Using Hierarchical Knowledge Structures to Implement Dynamic FAQ Systems</title>
        <year>2004</year>
        <page>496-507</page>
        <journal>Practical Aspects of Knowledge Management</journal>
        <abstract>This paper presents a knowledge representation that allows building hierarchical structures that can
            be used to build dynamically solutions to solve a particular user question. The goal of this work is to show
            how it is possible to define (and handle) a new knowledge representation that allows the integration of
            Case-based Knowledge into a graph-based representation that can be easily learned and managed. The
            combination of both, Case-based Knowledge and graphs allows to implement a flexible hierarchical structures
            (or learning graphs) that have been applied to implement a new kind of Frequently Asked Questions Systems.
            In these systems the output is dynamically built from the user query, using as basis structures the
            knowledge retrieved from a Case Base. The paper shows how the management of these cases allow enriching the
            knowledge base. Finally, the paper shows a specific application of this technique, in particular a Web
            system named DynJAQ (Dynamic Java Asked Questions). DynJAQ is a FAQ system that is able to generate
            dynamically several HTML guides that can be used to answer any possible question about a particular
            programming language (Java). Keywords: Knowledge Representation, Case-Based Reasoning, Intelligent Web
            Systems.

        <abstract>Recently, there hits been a rebirth of empiricism in the field of natural language processing. Manual
            encoding of linguistic information is being challenged by automated corpus-based learning as a method of
            providing a natural language processing system with linguistic knowledge. Although corpus-based approaches
            have been successful in many different areas of natural language processing, it is often the case that these
            methods capture the linguistic information they are modelling indirectly in large opaque tables of
            statistics. This can make it difficult to analyze, understand and improve the ability of these approaches to
            model underlying linguistic behavior. In this paper, we will describe a simple rule-based approach to
            automated learning of linguistic knowledge. This approach has been shown for a number of tasks to capture
            information in a clearer and more direct fashion without a compromise in performance. We present a detailed
            case study of this learning method applied to part-of-speech tagging.

        <abstract>Trigrams'n'Tags (TnT) is an efficient statistical part-of-speech tagger. Contrary to claims found
            elsewhere in the literature, we argue that a tagger based on Markov models performs at least as well as
            other current approaches, including the Maximum Entropy framework. A recent comparison has even shown that
            TnT performs significantly better for the tested corpora. We describe the basic model of TnT, the techniques
            used for smoothing and for handling unknown words. Furthermore, we present evaluations on two corpora.

        <abstract>In a porous metal bed, two-dimensional heat and mass transfer are analyzed for hydrogen absorption in
            the cylindrical coordinates. For high cooling rates an annular geometry is selected for the porous metal
            bed, and the bed is cooled by a fluid on both the internal and the external surfaces. The absorption process
            is analyzed numerically for the porous LaNi5 P/M metal bed. Variations of the metal hydride temperature and
            hydrogen/metal atomic ratio are calculated in the radial and axial directions using a computational fluid
            dynamics (CFD) program. It is observed that the hydride formation takes places near the cold boundaries. The
            results are compared with the numerical results given in the literature for different geometries. (c) 2005

        <abstract>We present a new approach for modeling multi-modal data sets, focusing on the specific case of
            segmented images with associated text. Learning the joint distribution of image regions and words has many
            applications. We consider in detail predicting words associated with whole images (auto-annotation) and
            corresponding to particular image regions (region naming). Auto-annotation might help organize and access
            large collections of images. Region naming is a model of object recognition as a process of translating
            image regions to words, much as one might translate from one language to another. Learning the relationships
            between image regions and semantic correlates (words) is an interesting example of multi-modal data mining,
            particularly because it is typically hard to apply data mining techniques to collections of images. We
            develop a number of models for the joint distribution of image regions and words, including several which
            explicitly learn the correspondence between regions and words. We study multi-modal and correspondence
            extensions to Hofmann's hierarchical clustering/aspect model, a translation model adapted from statistical
            machine translation (Brown et at.), and a multi-modal extension to mixture of latent Dirichlet allocation
            (MoM-LDA). All models are assessed using a large collection of annotated images of real scenes. We study in
            depth the difficult problem of measuring performance. For the annotation task, we look at prediction
            performance on held out data. We present three alternative measures, oriented toward different types of
            task. Measuring the performance of correspondence methods is harder, because one must determine whether a
            word has been placed on the right region of an image. We can use annotation performance as a proxy measure,
            but accurate measurement requires hand labeled data, and thus must occur on a smaller scale. We show results
            using both an annotation proxy, and manually labeled data.

        <page>3418-3424 4236</page>
        <journal>Proceedings of 2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, Vols 1-7</journal>
        <abstract>In this paper we present a pioneering step in designing n-gram based part of speech tagger for the
            Urdu language. In the last few years part of speech tagging work has been done in the area of supposed
            English, South Asian and European languages. In this paper our focus of attention is on the disambiguation
            problem (to assign the accurate tag for every word of a set of possible tags). Our approach employs n-gram
            Markov Model, train from annotated Urdu corpus and assigns possible tags to text. The proposed n-gram part
            of speech tagger has been tested which achieved state of the art performance of 95.0%. Furthermore, we check
            our experiment results of two type of tagset. Along the way, we apply evaluation method that shows how
            significant our experiment results are. Besides, we present the error analysis (Confusion Matrix) and show
            the tagging example of Urdu tagging. We also present overview of Urdu language. The contribution of our work
            is an initial step of statistical based Urdu part of speech tagger.

        <abstract>We propose a unique cluster-based retrieval (CBR) strategy using a new cluster-skipping inverted file
            for improving query processing efficiency. The new inverted file incorporates cluster membership and
            centroid information along with the usual document information into a single structure. In our
            incremental-CBR strategy, during query evaluation, both best(-matching) clusters and the best(-matching)
            documents of such clusters are computed together with a single posting-list access per query term. As we
            switch from term to term, the best clusters are recomputed and can dynamically change. During query-document
            matching, only relevant portions of the posting lists corresponding to the best clusters are considered and
            the rest are skipped. The proposed approach is essentially tailored for environments where inverted files
            are compressed, and provides substantial efficiency improvement while yielding comparable, or sometimes
            better, effectiveness figures. Our experiments with various collections show that the incremental- CBR
            strategy using a compressed cluster-skipping inverted file significantly improves CPU time efficiency,
            regardless of query length. The new compressed inverted file imposes an acceptable storage overhead in
            comparison to a typical inverted file. We also show that our approach scales well with the collection size.

        <abstract>Effective indexing is crucial for providing convenient access to scanned versions of large collections
            of historically valuable handwritten manuscripts. Since traditional handwriting recognizers based on optical
            character recognition (OCR) do not perform well on historical documents, recently a holistic word
            recognition approach has gained in popularity as an attractive and more straightforward solution (Lavrenko
            et al. in proc. document Image Analysis for Libraries (DIAL'04), pp. 278-287,2004). Such techniques attempt
            to recognize words based on scalar and profile-based features extracted from whole word images. In this
            paper, we propose a new approach to holistic word recognition for historical handwritten manuscripts based
            on matching word contours instead of whole images or word profiles. The new method consists of robust
            extraction of closed word contours and the application of an elastic contour matching technique proposed
            originally for general shapes (Adamek and O'Connor in IEEE Trans Circuits Syst Video Technol 5: 2004). We
            demonstrate that multiscale contour-based descriptors can effectively capture intrinsic word features
            avoiding any segmentation of words into smaller subunits. Our experiments show a recognition accuracy of
            83%, which considerably exceeds the performance of other systems reported in the literature.
